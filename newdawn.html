        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
          This project is undertaken by Trent University Enactus to develop a
          platform for assisting the homeless population. As a part of the
          University's Enactus Club, I came up with this Project Idea to revive
          the conditions of the homeless and take a step towards No Poverty. The
          Project “New Dawn” aims to create a platform that will act as a census
          of the Homeless Population for the public to access and aid the
          population.
        </p>
        <p>
          This platform will be a Web Application that will allow the general
          public to create an account on the Web Application, add details about
          the homeless person they saw using geolocation services and comment if
          they helped a particular homeless person. This will give this
          community an identity and the general public, who truly wishes to
          help, will get a medium to find them and help them. The users will be
          able to locate a homeless person nearby to help them and also upload
          some small chores they are willing to hire a homeless person for. This
          will give an opportunity for the population to stand back on their
          feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a security conern when it comes to uploading inromation and
          location about homeless popilation. Therefore we will be expanding our
          porject's scope. We will be partnering with other non profit
          organizations and services like the ones that procide shelters. We
          would also collaborate with social workers to allow the general public
          and the social workers to connect with each other and help the
          homeless. For example, I can find a social worker near me if i have a
          small "job" for the homeless. This way we consider the security issues
          regarding the homeless and the general public as well. New Dawn will
          also come up with services like "Donations" that allows users to
          donate, of which the entire procedings go towards the homesless
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many reasons that urban residential areas are deemed as not
          socially sustainable. It can be either due to the environments
          conditions of the area or unsanitary reasons(stagnant water/ garbage/
          infestations) or the population type residing nearby. Homeless people
          are often misunderstood and therefore considered unacceptable. This in
          turn leads to desperate times for them which then calls for desperate
          measures and therefore lead to an increase in the crime rate in the
          neighborhood. This project aims to provide opportunities to the
          population and therefore create a more socially sustainable urban
          residential buildings.
