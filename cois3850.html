        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
          As a part of the Project Management course's group project assignment,
          we decided to build a Website for New International students that
          guides them since they get the University offer letter until the first
          day of classes. As a group of 4, we came up with the project idea
          together considering the timeline & requirements as a University
          student. Our aim was to implement Agile Methodology and finish the
          project within the 8 weeks. Each Sprint was 2 weeks long, followed by
          the final presentation after the 8 weeks. We had 2 weeks for the
          initial planning and gathering requirements where we identified out
          project, met with the client and gathered requirements. Our project
          had a large scope which we narrowed down to the initial and most
          important steps to accommodate in the 8 week period.
        </p>
        <p>
          We followed Agile, SCRUM and maintained documentations while
          development and testing. I took the responsibility as the SCRUM Master
          and the curator to manage all submissions, documentations, and the
          Kanboard. We developed the homepage along with 11 steps that are to be
          completed before the first day of classes. Our project was very heavy
          on data and required consistent meetings with the client to fetch all
          information and get feedback on previous sprint's deliverables.
          Needless to say, we had a smooth ride throughout the duration of the
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          We divided our features into "Must Have", Nice to have" and "Good To
          have" to prioritize the project and consolidate the most important
          features to the 8-week time period. SCRUM really helped us in tracking
          our lessons learned and having consistent communication to maintain
          our project's deliverables and timeline. We faced a few obstacles, but
          Agile and SCRUM helped us push through and improve our mistakes. It
          was a wonderful journey that let us get a good insight in the Project
          Management world!
